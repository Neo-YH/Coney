Coding and Money

Everyone can benefit from an easy script designed to make  their life better. But not quiet a lot of people can do it by themself.  
The idea of Coney is to build a free platform supporting coding for good things. People in need can put their requests in Kanban and attach the price they think is reasonable. Others who are interested in can take over the corresponding tasks.

There should be some mechanisms to ensure the rights of buyers and salers are guarded at the same time. And the platform is only used for legitimate purposes conducive to mankind.
